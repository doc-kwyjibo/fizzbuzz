# Fizz buzz
![GitHub Workflow Status](https://github.com/doc-kwyjibo/fizzbuzz/actions/workflows/build-master.yml/badge.svg)
## Introduction

Fizz buzz is a division game where players count and replace numbers at certain multiples with other words. The traditional game replaces multiples of three by the word *fizz* and multiples of the five by the word *buzz*. Additionally, multiples of fifteen are replaced by the conjunction *fizzbuzz*.

The program will count up from one to a defined upper limit (typically 100), replacing multiples of two factors (typically 3 and 5) with replacement words (typically fizz and buzz respectively) and multiples of both factors by the conjunction of the two replacement words (fizzbuzz).

With divisors three and five, and replacement words fizz and buzz, the expected output with an upper limit of 100 is

## Purpose

This repository will add increasing levels of sophistication to the fizz buzz game. As additional releases are made, the program will be made to be more flexible and configurable in the vein of enterprise software. This application will not attempt to reach the state of [FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition). Typical business practices will be applied to highlight advantages that the application of some software principles can provide, while also showing how they can be applied too rigorously.

## Releases

TBA

## Development

This application will be progressed casually on my twitch streams, available at [https://twitch.tv/doc_kwyjibo](https://twitch.tv/doc_kwyjibo). Presently this project has no completion date and will progress slowly as I have motivation.
